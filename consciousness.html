    <h2>Drowsy Driving: Causes and How to Avoid It</h2>
        <p>Drowsy driving can cause microsleeps. Microsleep is a short, unintended loss of consciousness characterized by the closing of the eyes, head-snapping, or nodding. At 60 mph a 1-second microsleep means that the car will travel about 88 feet without the driver having any control.<br>Every year across the United States, almost 100,000 crashes are caused by drivers falling asleep at the wheel. Almost half of these involve drivers between 15 and 24 years old. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The only way to stop fatigue is by getting enough sleep.</span></p>
        <h2>What are the Early Signs of Drowsy Driving?</h2>
        <p>Below are some of the most common signs of drowsy driving. If you recognize any of them while driving, try to pull off the road and get some rest before continuing.</p>
        <li>Missing road signs</li>
        <li>Slow reactions</li>
        <li>Tired, sore or heavy eyes</li>
        <li>Daydreaming</li>
        <li>Struggling to stay in the lane</li>
        <li>Troubles changing gear</li>
        <li>Poor concentration</li>
        <li>Drowsiness</li>
        <li>Blurred vision</li>
        <h2>How to Avoid Drowsy Driving</h2>
        <li>Don’t drive when tired!</li>
        <li>Drive with a companion – that way you can switch drivers every once in a while.</li>
        <li>Schedule regular stops (e.g. 15 minutes every 2 hours).</li>
        <li>Avoid driving just after waking up. Your body won’t have adjusted fully.</li>
        <li>Don’t take alcohol and/or medications to become more alert. It will have the opposite effect.</li>
